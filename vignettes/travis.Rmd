## Authentication

The first time any function of {travis} is called, it will check for the existence of a Travis API key (for the respective endpoint).
This is a one-time procedure and needs to be done for each endpoint `.org` and `.com`.
Without the API key, no requests to the API of Travis CI can be made.

When calling `browse_travis_toke()`, a browser window will open.
After logging in, the API key for the respective endpoint can be copied.

This key can be stored in 

- environment variables `R_TRAVIS_ORG` or `R_TRAVIS_COM`

- or in file `~/.travis/config.yml` (see `?browse_travis_token()` for help)

Storing it in one of these is enough.
The second option is provided because it represents the way an API key is stored when using the [Travis CI CLI tool](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb).

## Setting the default endpoint

Travis [announced in May 2018](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2018-05-02-open-source-projects-on-travis-ci-com-with-github-apps) to migrate open-source repositories from https://travis-ci.org to https://travis-ci.com.
Since then, two endpoints (`.org` and `.com`) exist on which users can run their builds.
To make it easier for the users to specify a default for the endpoint when using the {travis} package rather than having to specify the `endpoint` argument in all functions, one can set the environment variable `R_TRAVIS`

```r
# example for .com
R_TRAVIS = ".com"
```

in `.Renviron` to the desired endpoint.
If none is set, {travis} will by default use the `.org` endpoint.

## Migrating from .org to .com

Since there is quite some confusion on the difference of these endpoints and if one should migrate, we try to give some answers:

- There is no difference in features between the endpoints

- Once migrated an account/organization to `.com` via the migrate button, there is no way back. 
  Meaning there is no chance to start builds ever again on `.org`.
  
- Via the API one could in the past enable repositories on both endpoints without a full migration.
  However, this seem to have changed lately upstream on Travis CI and might now work anymore.
  
We will not make a statement whether you should migrate your repositories to the `.com` endpoint.
However, at some point Travis CI will probably force the migration and since the endpoint exists since quite some time, things should be somewhat stable.

## How {travis} scrapes the repository information

{travis} scrapes information about the current repository from Github (currently only Github is supported).
To do so, {travis} looks at the git repo slug and extracts the <owner:repo> information.

Then, the [{gh}](https://github.com/r-lib/gh) package is used to query information about the repository and the current user.
This is important for some functions which try to add keys (SSH keys, deploy keys) to the Github repo or to Travis CI.

For this, the {gh} package needs access to the Github API via and relies also on a token, in this case a `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
You can create one using `usethis::browse_github_token()` (if you haven't done so yet) and store it as an environment variable again.

## Workflow example

With an existing project that exists on Github, one can

1. Enable the repository on Travis

    ```r
    travis::enable()
    ```

1. Enable deployment for this repository

   ```r
   travis::use_travis_deploy()
   ```

1. Browse the repo on Travis

    ```r
    travis::browse_travis()
    ```

and of course also use all the other [`travis_*()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/travis/reference/index.html) functions.
