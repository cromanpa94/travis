The goal of the _travis_ pkg is to simplify the setup of continuous integration with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/).
The package supports both Travis CI endpoints `.org` and `.com`.
Besides simplifying the deployment setup for Travis by creating a SSH key pair, the _travis_ package provides a command-line way in R to execute tasks which are usually done in the browser (build checking, cache deletion, build restarts, etc.).

To learn more about Travis CI in general, read [this blog post](http://mahugh.com/2016/09/02/travis-ci-for-test-automation/) and the [Getting Started](https://ropenscilabs/tic/articles/tic.html#prerequisites) vignette of the _tic_ package.

## Authentication

The first time any function is called, it will check for the existence of a Travis API key (for the respective endpoint).
This is a one-time procedure and needs to be done for each endpoint `.org` and `.com`.
By calling `browse_travis_toke()` you can query the API key for the respective endpoint and use either

- env vars `R_TRAVIS_ORG` or `R_TRAVIS_COM` for storing it

- store it in file `~/.travis/config.yml` (see `?browse_travis_token()` for help)

_travis_ scrapes information about the current repository from Github (currently only Github is supported).
To be able to do this, a `GITHUB_TOKEN` is needed.
You can create one using `usethis::browse_github_token()` if you haven't done so yet.

## Workflow example

1. Create a repository on GitHub (if none exists)

    ```r
    gh::gh("POST /user/repos", name = "my-new-repo-for-gh-testing")
    ```

1. Enable the repository on Travis

    ```r
    travis::enable()
    ```

1. Enabled deployment for this repository

   ```r
   travis::use_travis_deploy()
   ```

1. Browse the repo on Travis

    ```r
    travis::browse_travis()
    ```
